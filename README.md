# Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Description 
This was a guided project designed and created by [Mo Chen](https://www.youtube.com/@mo-chen) to use multiple Excel Data Analysis techniques to create a dynamic dashboard, allowing even non-technical stakeholders to instantly grasp key insights into coffee sales data. Data cleaning and formatting was performed to create clear and leggible data in the initial source. Multiple lookup formulas were used to populate created columns. Pivot tables and subsequent charts were built for data visualization. Additionally, multiple slicers and a timeline were designed to better filter the data by time and multiple categories such as weight, roast type and loyalty card possession. 

## Overview & Aim
To build an interactive and dynamic dashboard in Excel to better visualize and analyze coffee sales across the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.
